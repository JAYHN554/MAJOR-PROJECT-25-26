# 🧬 Organ Donation Registry using Blockchain and AI-Powered Matching

An innovative system to securely register organ donors and recipients using blockchain, while leveraging AI to intelligently match them in real time based on medical compatibility.

## 🚀 Objectives
- Real-time donor-recipient matching using AI
- Immutable, tamper-proof donor/recipient records via blockchain
- Instant notifications on organ availability
- Smart contracts for transparent, automated allocation
- Real-time tracking of organ transport
